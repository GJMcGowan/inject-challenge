Inject Challenge (Makers Academy)
================

Our challenge was to rewrite the [.inject](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.2/Enumerable.html#method-i-inject) method in the ruby array class. 

To install, clone this repo into your local machine and run ```bundle```, then ```rspec```

My solution passes all the neccessary tests, however the code could definitely be a lot cleaner.
